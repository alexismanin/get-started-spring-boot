= Get started with Spring Boot

== What you will learn

 * Create a simple Spring Boot application
 * How to use Spring *profiles* to custom deployed components
 * How to use Spring https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config[external configuration] to customize environment settings/properties
 * An introduction to Webflux engine
 * An introduction to RSocket

== Requirements

 * A JDK 8 or superior (I recommend at least 17)
 * An IDE (IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.)

== Start practice:

The main branch head contains all code and documentation.
To start practice, you can checkout tag *practice-start*.
From this tag, each commit to main head is a succession of practice instructions and solutions.

*Tip*: launch Spring boot app with a dedicated profile:
`gradle bootRun --args="--spring.profiles.active=$PROFILE"`
