== Exercise

For practice, we will create a very simple client/server Hello world program.

We will make two applications:
 * One that provide an HTTP Get endpoint that send "Hello" plain text response.
 * Another that will call the API above, and print it in the console.

=== Step 1 : create the project

First and foremost, we'll use https://start.spring.io[Spring online starter] to create a simple application with *Reactive web* support.

. Go to the linked page
. choose your preferred language and build system (radio buttons on the left)
. Specify a package, title, etc.
. On the right side, use *add dependencies* button to search and add *Reactive web*.
